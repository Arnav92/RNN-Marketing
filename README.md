The main.py program is what I use to help come up with interesting slogans.

This was used for a student research project in collaboration with small businesses
to help them generate catchy slogans. Another python program was used to scrape
10,000+ marketing slogans from successful businesses like Nike, and Apple, but
I do not have permission to share that code (main.py was also different to the provided
code, in that it also collected data from the file of slogans).

I have provided a small dataset of slogans, but this will produce poor results.
Hence, if you desire to use this to generate good slogans, at least generate more data.

The python file provided would need to be copy-pasted into a new project, 
and the libraries in the file need to be installed.
To do this, create a project in your desired IDE (I used Intellij as the IDE)
and download the libraries that error in the python files.
Notably, the keras library may error even after installing, suggesting it's not installed,
but the program will still successfully run, despite the error still appearing. I am
unsure why this happens, at least on my computer, but the program still works fine.
